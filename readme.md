This is tasks for deep learning course in Udacity.
There are 6 tasks in total.

###Task1 notMNIST###
Training a simple logistic regression model.

Notice: I cannot open the original url(maybe it's blocked), and I found an answer told me to use 'http://yaroslavvb.com/upload/notMNIST/' instead. But it's very slow, you can download and extract data manually.

I have solved all the problems except problem 5.
Problem6 is finished using tensorflow.

###Task2 fullyconnected###
This part need to train a simple neural network using ReLu function.

Finished

###Task3 regularization###
This part need to finish L2 and drop regularization, and then build a multi-layer network.

I have built a network with 2 hidden layers. The accury on test data is 95%

###Task4 covolutional neural network###
This part need to build a multipe layer network with covolutional layer and pool layer

The accuracy is only 93% at most.
