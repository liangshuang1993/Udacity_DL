This is tasks for deep learning course in Udacity.
There are 6 tasks in total.

###Task1 notMNIST###
Training a simple logistic regression model.

Notice: I cannot open the original url(maybe it's blocked), and I found an answer told me to use 'http://yaroslavvb.com/upload/notMNIST/' instead. But it's very slow, you can download and extract data manually.

I have solved all the problems except problem 5.
Problem6 is finished using tensorflow.

###Task2 fullyconnected###
This part need to train a simple neural network using ReLu function.

Finished
